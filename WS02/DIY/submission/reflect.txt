Autheticity Declaraition :
I declare that I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the
code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

*************************************************************************/

In workshop 2, I learned how to use function overloading and I implied it to read() function in File module and in display() and load() functions in Student module, in part 1. I also use the same concept in DIY part while reading data form bd.csv file. This was my first project where I use heap memory in coding. The main purpose of using heap memory is it allows programmers to allocate memory dynamically for any type of data type. When I first tried to run the part 1, it showed me an error that 1 block of heap memory was still reachable, and I soon figured out what was the problem. I forgot to close the file which caused this error. To solve it I added closeFile() function in the load function in Student module.
    bool load(const char* filename)
    {
        ......

        openFile(filename);

        ......

        closeFile(); // not adding this caused problem

        return returnValue;
    }
After that I successfully uploaded the part 1. For DIY part, when I was trying -feedback submission, I got error which showed illegal use of free()/ delete/ delete[] in void endSearch() function. So I soon figured out the problem. The problem was :
1	void endSearch()
2	{
3		delete fileName;
4
5		cout << "Birthdate Search Program Closed." << endl;
6	}
In line 4, I used delete because I forgot that pointer filename was pointing to char array, then I added [] after delete and the problem was solved:
1	void endSearch()
2	{
3		delete[] fileName; // solved
4
5		cout << "Birthdate Search Program Closed." << endl;
6	}
I have had some endl errors as well but I solved it pretty easily. After that I completed my reflection and submitted the files successfully.

So the main topic covered in this workshops were how to use heap memory for dynamic memory allocation and how to overload function which is a part of polymorphism in oops concepts.
