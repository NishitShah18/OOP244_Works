Due to the professor's detailed listing of the member functions' instructions, constructors, and function characteristics, all implementations were quite simple. I had to use the allocator module in this session to handle many bank accounts, including a savings account and a checking account. The only challenge I ran into was when I created a global function called CreateAccount to generate accounts from the various account types that were available after defining the account rates and charges. I spent some time thinking and searching through class notes before coming up with the idea of using the switch-case approach for applying the condition, and it worked. Initially, I was unable to figure out how to receive the address of the C string in the CreateAccount. I was successful in getting the expected results for the workshop.-> Moreover, I have already finished Milestones 1 and 2 of the final project, and I am now working on Milestone 3. In the previous reflection for workshop 7, I discussed my first milestone. In the second milestone, I was required to create a mock-up version of the Seneca Library Application in the LibApp module. Because I only needed to complete one module and some modules were same as milestone 1, their implementation was quite simple. The professor also provided instructions exactly how they should have been. Overall, I had no problems completing Milestone 2 and did it smoothly.
