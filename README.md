# Subject Title

Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

<hr>

# Subject Description

This subject introduces the student to object-oriented programming. The student learns to build reusable objects, encapsulate data and logic within a class, inherit one class from another and implement polymorphism.  This subject uses the C++ programming language exclusively and establishes a foundation for learning system analysis and design and more advanced concepts as implemented in languages such as C++, Java, C# and Objective-C.

# Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this subject the student will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Design classes with dynamically allocated resources to model the components of a programming solution
</li>
<li>Design member functions using logic constructs to solve tasks of linear complexity
</li>
<li>Relate classes using inheritance hierarchies to minimize the duplication of object code
</li>
<li>Design polymorphic objects to amplify the reusability of program code
</li>
<li>Use stream objects to interact with users and access persistent data
</li>
<li>Trace the execution of object-oriented code to validate its correctness
</li>
<li>Code a complete program using polymorphic objects to solve a systems or business problem
</li>
<li>Explain the purpose of an object-oriented programming feature to inform a business person
</li>
</ul>
