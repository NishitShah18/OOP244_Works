In this workshop 7, I learned how to inherit a derived class from a base class and how to use input/output operators with two different classes. I had to implement two modules called MemberParliament and Minister, in which I had to inherit the Minister class from the MemberParliament class. Overall, the workshop was simple, and I had no difficulty implementing the functions, custom constructors, and operators in both modules. The most difficult part of this workshop was accessing and shadowing the copy function Object() { [native code] } in the Minister module from the MemberParliament module, but I figured it out after going over the notes and researching the concepts of derived classes and inheritance on the internet.

I've finished the first milestone of my final project and am currently working on the second. I had considerable trouble finishing the Menu module in Milestone 1 since I needed to implement two separate classes, and I was unable to make the run function and the member insertion method for the Menu class. However, I was able to effectively implement those functions only after investing a lot of time in study, watching lecture recordings.
